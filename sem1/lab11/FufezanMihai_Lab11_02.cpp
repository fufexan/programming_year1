 * Consider an application for managing a companyâ€™s distributed activity (5
 * different cities with 3 selling points in each one of them). Define a
 * function that declares an array of float pointers, each pointer being used
 * for referencing a heap zone of memory that stores 3 float values that
 * represent the total sales at the end of day. The program needs to process the
 * data using functions for:
 * - reading the data for all the selling points from all the cities;
 * - calculating and returning the total amount of sales in every city. The
 * values will be centralized in the main function and the average value will be
 * displayed.
 * - eliberating all the used memory
