 * Write a C++ application that defines the abstract base class
 * AbstractQuadrilateral having as protected attributes four instances of the
 * Point class (a pair of x and y coordinates, getter and setter methods) that
 * represent the quadrilateralâ€™s corners. Declare two pure virtual methods for
 * determining the area and the perimeter of the shape. Implement the derived
 * class ActualQuadrilateral that implements the inherited abstract methods and
 * has another method for determining whether the quadrilateral is a square,
 * rectangle, or irregular quadrilateral. Instantiate the derived class and call
 * the defined methods. The area will be determined depending on the
 * quadrilateral type. The irregularr convex quadrilateral are wil be determined
 * considering the following formula that express the area in terms of the sides
 * a, b, c, d, the semiperimeter s, and the diagonals p, q: A=sqrt
 * {(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-1/4(ac+bd+pq)(ac+bd-pq)}. At the irregularr concave
 * quadrilateral will be determined only the perimeter.
