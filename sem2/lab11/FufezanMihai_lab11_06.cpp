/*

 *
 * Define a class called Record that stores the data related to a melody
 * (artist, title, duration). An abstract class (Playlist) contains as private
 * attribute a pointer to an array of records. The pointer is initialized in the
 * constructor by a memory allocation process (the number of records is defined
 * by the user). The class contains accessor and mutator methods for each of a
 * recordâ€™s fields and an abstract method (pure virtual) that sorts the records
 * array according to a criteria coded in the received parameter (1=sorting by
 * title, 2=sorting by artist, 3=sorting by duration). The abstract method is
 * implemented inside another class (PlaylistImplementation) that inherits the
 * Playlist class. In the main( ) function, instantiate the
 * PlaylistImplementation class and initialize and use all the related data and
 * methods.
