 * Declare a class called Animal that contains a pure virtual method (breathe())
 * and 2 virtual methods (eat() and sleep()). The classes Dog and Fish inherit
 * the first class in a public mode and implements the pure virtual method. The
 * class Dog overrides the eat() method. The class Fish overrides the sleep()
 * method. Instantiate the derived classes and call the specific methods. After
 * that, define an array of Animal objects that will contain instances of the
 * derived classes, if thatâ€™s possible. If not, find an appropriate solution.
